The main features that this site currently has is the ability to add to a color, palette export, the color palette, and clear a color palette. These features are built out and should work. Running on GIT the pallet feature is slower. If it is your first time on the browser using the site, it may take longer for the changes to be shown in the palette. However, it does work. For the add, export and clear substantial parts of the task are built out, including pop-up screens confirming that that is what the user wants to do. Additional error handling is implemented through the site storing  the information that the user selects. This means that the user does not have to put in input and instead when it clicks a button, the button knows what input to store. This reduces user error because the user is not inputting strings and just clicking buttons.
